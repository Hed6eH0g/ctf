The statement was a clue for the flag.
As we search the keyword "rubber ducky", it was easily found that the attached binary `inject.bin` is a kind of BadUSB.
There is an [online toolkit](https://ducktoolkit.com/) for decoding [USB RUBBER DUCKY](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky) and thus, we can get the flag with that toolkit.
