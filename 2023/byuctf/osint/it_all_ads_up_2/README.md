As well as the previous challenge, we began by searching the image with Google Images but no clue for the flag was found.
So, googling with "NHL teams home places" leads to [this page](https://geojango.com/pages/list-of-nhl-teams) and looked for the sponsers.
Since there are "DELTA" and "GEICO" in the images, we extract the candidates according to this companies.
Fortunatelly, it was found by the insite search that there are only two teams that "DELTA" is being their sponser.
We tried them turn by turn and it was found that the flag was Crypto.com Areana.
