An .ova format was provided and we were expected to work on the virtual machine.
As the satatement says, we imported it and started ubuntu with `major` (this is the passsword for decrypting the volume).

Since we know that there is an option for the people who lost their user credentials, we can exploit it and get the root shell in the VM.
Based on [this post](https://www.tecmint.com/reset-forgotten-root-password-in-ubuntu/), we could get the root shell and look for flags.

In short, reboot the guest machine and press `shift` until the GRUB boot prompt comes ups.
From the GRUB boot prompt, press the `e` button (see Fig. 1) to edit the first boot option and replace `linux   /vmlinuz-4.15.0-208-generic root=/dev/mapper/MI6--v\g-root ro quiet splash $vt_handoff` with `linux   /vmlinuz-4.15.0-208-generic root=/dev/mapper/MI6--v\g-root rw init=/bin/bash`(see Fig. 2).

Then, press `F10` for saving the change and booting ubuntu leads us to the password input screen (see Fig. 3).

After that the root shell is launched (see Fig. 4)

The flags for MI6configuration 1, 3, and 4 are as follows:
